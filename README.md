Chris Tu

V1.0 (demo): 
------------

Input a bill amount down to the cent.

Segmented picker selects the desired tip percentage.

Button Interface increments the number of guests splitting the bill (evenly).

- Displays subtotal amount, tip amount, and grand total (with tip) per person.
- Displays subtotal amount, tip amount, and grand total (with tip) for the group.

Plans for V1.1
--------------

Allow “guests” to be structures that contain their own items and item cost. 
Item breakdown per person for subtotal and tip and grand total. 
Include tax in calculation. 
Have a tax input box to calculate small data: tax percentage. 
Item breakdown for subtotal and tip and tax and grand total per person. 

Future Plans:
-------------

Create receipt items that contain date (default is current system time), restaurant, and memo, insert into database so you can see summary and history of restaurant bills.
